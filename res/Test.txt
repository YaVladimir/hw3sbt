This the story the happened in May exactly on that bench,
Where Berlioz and the Homeless argued about the nature of Christ.
My friends and I also argued about the possibility of making money on our iPhone-game.
I, suddenly, said that without investing money this is impossible.
My opponents, even geniuses, reluctantly agreed. I strengthened the trolling and added: -
My friends, without big money it's absolutely impossible!
Any amount less than $25,000, spent on the promotion of the application - will turn into a zipper. Pshshshsh!
Everyone was indignant and drove me off the bench. At the same time, and from Moscow.
